				"format" : ".csv, .rtf",
				"description" : "1. Despite worldwide reports of high tree mortality, growing evidence indicates that many tree species are well adapted to survive repeated dry spells. The drought resilience of trees is related to their phenotypic plasticity and ecotypic differentiation. Whether these two mechanisms act at the same organisational level of a tree and involve similar plant traits is still unknown. 2. We assessed phenotypic plasticity and ecotypic differentiation across four populations of Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra seedlings grown for three years under a recurrent summer drought treatment or well-watered control conditions in a common garden. We measured the response to the summer drought treatment of a total of 26 traits including shoot and needle morphology, needle anatomy, and foliar macronutrients, and related the traits to the growing season water deficit (GSWD) at the location of the seed origin. 3. Foliar phenotypic plasticity in response to recurrent summer drought was surprisingly low, with the needle length and the fraction of mesophyll and phloem tissue adjusting to some extent. In comparison, shoot morphological traits were much more plastic in both species with predominant responses to the summer drought stress including shorter and less numerous apical and lateral shoots. These three traits were also correlated with GSWD at the seed origin, indicating local adaptation. In contrast, between-population variation of foliar morphological and anatomical traits, and macronutrients were mostly unrelated to the GSWD at the seed origin. 4. Consequently, phenotypic plasticity and ecotypic differentiation occurred at the same level of organisation and in the same plant traits, i.e. shoot morphology. This combination of plasticity and ecotypic differentiation allowed P. sylvestris and P. nigra seedlings to rapidly acclimate to recurrent and long-lasting dry-spells. 5. Synthesis: P. sylvestris and P. nigra seedlings showed considerable ecotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity of shoot morphological traits, and not foliar traits. Acclimation to recurrent severe summer drought was achieved by reducing shoot growth.",

				"description" : "To elucidate the sources and chemical reaction pathways of organic vapors and particulate matter in the ambient atmosphere, real-time detection of both gas and particle phase is needed. State-of-the-art techniques often suffer from thermal decomposition, ionization-induced fragmentation, high cut-off size of aerosols or low time resolution. In response to all these limitations, we developed a new technique that uses extractive electrospray ionization (EESI) for online gas and particle chemical speciation, namely the dual-phase extractive electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Dual-Phase-EESI-TOF or Dual-EESI in short). The Dual-EESI was designed and optimized to measure gas- and particle-phase species with saturation vapor concentrations spanning more than 10 orders of magnitude with good linearity and a measurement cycle as fast as 3 min. The gas-phase selectivity of the Dual-EESI was compared with that of nitrate chemical ionization mass spectrometry. In addition, we performed organic aerosol uptake experiments to characterize the relative gas and particle response factors. In general, the Dual-EESI is more sensitive toward gas-phase analytes as compared to their particle-phase counterparts. The real-time measurement capability of the Dual-EESI for chemically speciated gas- and particle-phase measurements can provide new insights into aerosol sources or formation mechanisms, where gas-particle partitioning behavior can be determined after absolute parameterization of the gas/particle sensitivity.",

				"description" : "Dataset abstract The authors would highly appreciate being contacted if the data is used for any purpose. We measured sulfuric acid concentration in the gas phase with a nitrate chemical ionization mass spectrometer (we used an APi-HTOF mass spectrometer produced by Tofwerk AG coupled with a Chemical ionization inlet A70 produced by Airmodus). Sulfuric acid is detected in the mass spectrometer either as a deprotonated ion or as a cluster with the reagent ion (NO3-). The concentration is calculated as the area of these two peaks normalized to the concentration of the reagent ions (monomer, dimer and trimer) and multiplied by a calibration factor that was experimentally derived at Paul Scherrer Institute in the summer 2017, after the campaign. In the atmosphere, sulfuric acid is produced by the oxidation of sulfur dioxide that could have both a natural or anthropogenic origin (e.g. phytoplankton emission or fossil fuel combustion). Sulfuric acid in the atmosphere is responsible for a very large fraction of the newly formed particles, therefore it is important to have accurate measurements of this vapour in remote places like the Southern Ocean to better understand secondary aerosol sources and processes. The data have been cleaned from the influence of the exhaust of the research vessel. Temporal coverage is from January 22, 2017 to March 19, 2017. There are no data for the first leg of the expedition because the instrument was not on the ship. The instrument was operated during leg 4 but data has not been processed yet as they require additional work due to some instrumental issues that affects their quality. Data were collected with one-second time resolution but integrated to five minutes to increase the signal to noise ratio. Concentrations are reported as molecules per cubic centimeter. The lower limit of detection is in the ppq (part per quadrillion) range but was not determined exactly as it varies with the integration time and background noise.

The concentration and temporal dynamics of small particles is fundamental to characterize the first step of new particle formation (NPF) and growth. Moreover, naturally charged particles and ions can provide information about the role of ion induced nucleation. Newly formed particles can grow to larger sizes where they act as cloud condensation nuclei, directly affecting the Earth radiative budget and cloud properties. Measurements were performed on the upper deck of icebreaker Akademik Tryoshnikov along the track of the Antarctic Circumnavigation expedition. Temporal coverage is from January 22, 2017 to April 11, 2017. The concentration is reported as dN/dlog(Dp) per cubic centimetre, where Dp indicates the corresponding diameter size bin. Data were collected with one-second time resolution and averaged automatically by the acquisition software to 120 seconds before January 31 2017 and to 90 seconds after that date. The instrument was calibrated before the campaign by the manufacturer and periodically cleaned during the campaign (one time per leg). Pollution from the ship exhaust and other human activities (e.g. helicopter flights) was identified as described in Schmale et al., 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-18-0187.1) and a corresponding flag was associated to the data (with 1 meaning clean data and 0 polluted data).   ***** Dataset contents ***** - 01_neutral_particles_size_distribution.csv, data file, comma-separated values - 02_negative_ions_size_distribution.csv, data file, comma-separated values - 03_positive_ions_size_distribution.csv, data file, comma-separated values - 04_neutral_particles_size_distribution_header.txt, metadata, text - 05_negative_ions_size_distribution_header.txt, metadata, text - 06_positive_ions_size_distribution_header.txt, metadata, text - README.txt, metadata, text Data that were missing or bad because of instrumental problems were simply removed from the file (no entry).",

				"description" : "The Pollution Detection Algorithm (PDA) is an algorithm to identify and flag periods of primary polluted data in remote atmospheric time series in five steps. The first and most important step identifies polluted periods based on the gradient (time-derivative) of a concentration over time. If this gradient exceeds a given threshold, data are flagged as polluted. Further pollution identification steps are a simple concentration threshold filter, a neighboring points filter (optional), a median and a sparse data filter (optional). The PDA is written in python and runs from the command line. No GUI installation is needed. The script only relies on the target dataset file itself and is independent of ancillary datasets such as meteorological variables. All parameters of each step are adjustable so that the PDA can be “tuned” to be more or less stringent (e.g., flag more or less data points as polluted). The PDA was developed and tested with a particle number concentration dataset collected during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition in the Central Arctic.",

				"description" : "Major uranium (U) deposits worldwide are exploited by acid leaching, known as 'in-situ recovery' (ISR). ISR involves the injection of an acid fluid into ore-bearing aquifers and the pumping of the resulting metal-containing solution through cation exchange columns for the recovery of dissolved U. Rehabilitation of ISR-impacted aquifers could be achieved through natural attenuation, or via biostimulation of autochthonous heterotrophic microorganisms due to the associated acid neutralization and trace metal immobilization. In this study, we analyzed the capacity of pristine aquifer sediments impacted by diluted ISR fluids to buffer pH and immobilize U. The experimental setup consisted of glass columns, filled with sediment from a U ore-bearing aquifer, through which diluted ISR fluids were flowed continuously. The ISR solution was obtained from ISR mining operations at the Muyunkum and Tortkuduk deposits in Kazakhstan. Following this initial phase, columns were biostimulated with a mix of molasses, yeast extract and glycerol to stimulate the growth of autochthonous heterotrophic communities. Experimental results showed that this amendment efficiently promoted the activity of acid-tolerant bacterial guilds, with pH values rising from 4.8 to 6.5 - 7.0 at the outlet of the stimulated columns. The reduction of sulfate, nitrate, and metals as well as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia induced the rise in pH values, in agreement with geochemical modeling results. Biostimulation efficiently promoted the complete immobilization of U, with the accumulation of up to 3,343 ppm in the first few centimeters of the columns. Synchrotron analysis and SEM-EDS revealed that up to 60% of the injected hexavalent U was immobilized as tetravalent non-crystalline U onto bacterial cell surfaces. 16S rRNA amplicon analysis and qPCR data suggested a predominant role played for members of the Phylum Firmicutes (from the genera Clostridium, Pelosinus, and Desulfosporosinus) in biological U reduction and immobilization.",

				"description" : "Tamaas (from تماس meaning \"contact\" in Farsi) is a high-performance rough-surface periodic contact code based on boundary and volume integral equations. The clever mathematical formulation of the underlying numerical methods allows the use of the fast-Fourier Transform, a great help in achieving peak performance: Tamaas is consistently two orders of magnitude faster (and lighter) than traditional FEM! This means we can tackle such difficult problems as elastoplastic contact of rough surfaces with upwards of 100 million degrees-of-freedom on a single compute node (and more with MPI distributed parallelism). Online documentation can be found on tamaas.readthedocs.io. To give proper credit to Tamaas and the researchers who have developed the numerical methods that it implements, please cite the JOSS paper and the appropriate references therein (see README below for selected references).

The framework components, their mutual relationships, and framework tasks have been identified through a thorough and systematic literature review. Furthermore, the literature is positioned in the line with the framework. Finally, the framework and systematic literature review allowed us to identify gaps in the literature, and interesting research avenues.",

				"description" : "Many experiments have shown that biodiversity promotes ecosystem functioning and stability and that this relationship varies with resource availability. However, we still have a poor understanding of the underlying physiological and ecological mechanisms driving diversity effects and how they may interact with soil nutrient availability. We collected data in a grassland experiment factorially manipulating fertilization, species richness, functional composition (slow-growing vs. fast-growing species), and functional diversity in resource economic traits. We measured aboveground productivity, nitrogen (N) uptake, photosynthesis, and water use efficiency by combining a 15N labelling approach with productivity, gas exchange, and stable isotope measurements in three years differing in rainfall. We found that sown species richness increased aboveground productivity, N uptake and photosynthesis, suggesting that species richness is the most important driver of ecosystem productivity and nutrient cycling. Similarly, photosynthesis was affected by functional composition but not by functional diversity. Water use efficiency was reduced by sown species richness for communities dominated by slow growing species but not for communities dominated by fast growing species. Fertilization increased productivity, N uptake and water use efficiency. The positive effects of high species richness on ecosystem functions were independent of fertility levels. Synthesis. Our results provide evidence that high species richness in temperate grasslands could enhance productivity and reduce the negative impacts of drought events. Multiple factors and community characteristics are important in driving enhanced ecosystem functioning in biodiverse grasslands and seem to affect functioning and stability through different mechanisms.",
